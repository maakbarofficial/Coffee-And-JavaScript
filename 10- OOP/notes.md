# JavaScript and Classes

Yes, JavaScript introduced support for classes in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), which is a major update to the language. Classes provide a more structured and object-oriented way to define and work with objects in JavaScript. They make it easier to create constructor functions and prototype-based inheritance patterns.

Here's an example of defining a class in JavaScript:

<!--
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("John", 30);
person1.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John and I'm 30 years old."
 -->

## OOP

## Object

- collection of properties and methods
- e.g. toLowerCase, toUpperCase, new Keyword

## Why use OOP?

- to avoid spagetty code

## Parts of OOP

Object literal{}

- Constructor Function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars of OOP

Abstruction
Encapsulation
